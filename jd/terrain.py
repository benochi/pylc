# m√ón integer matrix grid, and two integers row and col. Each value in the grid represents the type of terrain at that location.

# Two cells are considered connected if they are adjacent (up, down, left, or right) and have the same terrain type.

# The perimeter of a connected component is defined as the number of edges that border cells that are not part of the connected component.

# Write a function to calculate the perimeter of the connected component that includes the cell at grid[row][col].

# Example:
# Input 1:
# python
# Copy code
# grid = [[1, 1, 0], 
#         [1, 0, 0], 
#         [1, 1, 1]]
# row = 1
# col = 0
# Output:
# 8

# Explanation:
# The connected component is [[1, 1, 0], [1, -, 0], [1, 1, 1]] (all 1s connected to grid[1][0]). Its perimeter is 8.

# Input 2:
# python
# Copy code
# grid = [[1, 1, 1], 
#         [1, 1, 1], 
#         [1, 1, 1]]
# row = 1
# col = 1
# Output:
# 0

# Explanation:
# The connected component is the entire grid. Its perimeter is 0 because there are no edges bordering cells outside the component.

# Input 3:
# python
# Copy code
# grid = [[1, 2, 2], 
#         [2, 3, 2], 
#         [1, 2, 3]]
# row = 0
# col = 1
# Output:
# 4

# Explanation:
# The connected component is [[1, 2, -], [-, 3, -], [-, -, -]]. Its perimeter is 4.

# Constraints:
# m == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 ‚â§ m,n ‚â§50
# 1 ‚â§ grid[i][j] ‚â§ 1000
# 0 ‚â§ row < m
# 0 ‚â§ col < n
